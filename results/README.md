### Slide Categories

Slides are graded regarding their completeness regarding *Content* and  their quality regarding *Style* and *Structure*.

* *Structure* graded how well follow a basic  order that helps the audience understand the points, which are conveyed by the presenter.
* *Style* grades the quality of the individual slides regarding understandability through media, text and also how well the individual slides fit together.

### Presenter Categories

The presenter is graded regarding the following categories:

* *Language* grades how appropriate and understandable the used language of the presenter is.

### Support Presenters
